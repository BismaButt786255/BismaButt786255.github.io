    <article>
        <p>Every 24 hours, over 150 people in the UK receive the life-altering news of a breast cancer diagnosis. Among females in the nation, breast cancer ranks as the second most common cause of cancer-related death. Amidst these sombre statistics, one may wonder why this is the case when we have witnessed remarkable strides in breast cancer treatment. The answer lies, in part, because of drug resistance. This is when cancer cells develop ways to escape the effects of medications, making them less effective over time. To overcome this challenge, researchers are working tirelessly to develop innovative drugs that will fortify our defences against this disease.</p>

        <h2>The Four Faces of Breast Cancer</h2>
        <p>The first step to developing effective treatments for breast cancer is understanding that this disease is not a single condition, but instead consists of four main subtypes. Each subtype presents a unique battleground, distinguished by the presence or absence of certain receptors on the surface of cancer cells. Receptors are proteins on the cell surface that can bind to specific substances, such as hormones or drugs, and trigger a response within the cell. It is important to recognize that each breast cancer subtype behaves differently and requires its own tailored treatment approach because of these differences.</p>

        <p>For example, hormone-driven luminal (A and B) breast cancers may develop resistance to hormonal therapies like the anti-estrogen drug tamoxifen. Similarly, cancers that overproduce a protein called HER2 may become less sensitive to therapies that target this protein, like the drug trastuzumab. Triple-negative breast cancer is already tough to treat, but it becomes even more challenging when it develops resistance to the standard chemotherapy used to treat it. Ultimately, understanding the unique characteristics of each subtype allows researchers to identify alternative targets to attack when current therapies no longer work.</p>

        <h2>Adding to the Arsenal</h2>

        <h3>ADCs</h3>
        <p>Among the new generation of weapons against breast cancer, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), offer a targeted strike against this disease. These drugs use an immune system protein called an antibody to target specific molecules abundant on the cancer cells. This allows the powerful anti-cancer drug that is attached to the antibody to precisely deliver its toxic effects to the tumour, effectively destroying it. It is clear that ADCs represent a promising approach in the fight against breast cancer, but do they deliver on their promise?</p>

        <p>Enter trastuzumab duocarmazine. This ADC targets HER2 and has shown positive outcomes for patients with elevated HER2 levels who don't respond to standard treatments like trastuzumab. In a study conducted in 2021, researchers found that trastuzumab duocarmazine helped patients keep their cancer under control for about 2 months longer than those who received a different treatment chosen by their doctor. Therefore, the outcome of this study offers hope to breast cancer patients let down by current HER2-targeted therapies. While we'll need to wait and see if this promising drug is approved for these patients, the potential it holds is definitely something to be optimistic about in the battle against drug resistance.</p>

        <h3>SERDs</h3>
        <p>The fight against drug resistance doesn't stop there. Luminal (A and B) breast cancers rely on hormones to fuel their growth. However, traditional treatments like tamoxifen that target these hormone receptors often encounter resistance. To overcome this, researchers are turning to a new class of drugs called selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs). While tamoxifen simply blocks estrogen from attaching to estrogen receptors on cancer cells, SERDs go a step further and break down these receptors. This makes SERDs more effective because even if cancer cells try to find another way to respond to estrogen, there's no receptor left for the signal to act on.</p>

        <p>In a 2022 study, encouraging results with a novel SERD called elacestrant were observed. The study included luminal breast cancer patients who had mutations in their estrogen receptors. These mutations allowed the cancer cells to ignore the usual treatments that target estrogen, making the cancer harder to treat. Compared to other treatments, elacestrant increased the time patients lived without their cancer getting worse, by almost 2 months. Given these results, it's hardly surprising that the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) swiftly approved elacestrant for luminal breast cancer patients who don't respond well to standard hormonal therapies. Overall, SERDs offer renewed possibilities for patients facing the challenges of hormonal treatment resistance.</p>

        <h3>Immunotherapy</h3>
        <p>Perhaps one of the most exciting advances, particularly for triple-negative breast cancer, is the rise of immunotherapy. Triple-negative breast cancer’s lack of specific receptors restricts the availability of targeted therapies, leading to limited treatment options when drug resistance emerges. Luckily, immunotherapy presents a promising solution. Instead of relying on receptor-based approaches, immunotherapy harnesses the body's immune system to fight cancer, offering a new treatment option for this subtype.</p>

        <p>One promising kind of immunotherapy includes immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). To understand how they work, we first need to grasp that T cells, immune cells that protect us from disease, contain checkpoint proteins that can activate or deactivate them. We want our T cells active only when fighting disease; prolonged activity can harm healthy cells. Now, cancer cells are clever—they can overproduce certain proteins that attach to these “off-switches” on T-cells. They essentially trick the immune system into thinking they're harmless, allowing them to grow and spread unchecked. This is where ICIs come in. They block this interaction between the cancer cells and T cells, preventing the “off” signal from being sent. This allows the T cells to recognize and attack the tumour.</p>

        <p>Pembrolizumab is an ICI that has shown favourable results for triple-negative breast cancer patients. In a 2020 study, researchers found that patients who took pembrolizumab along with chemotherapy had a higher chance of staying cancer-free for three years compared to those who only received chemotherapy.</p>

        <p><strong>“It will give hope to those who are diagnosed, and prevent the cancer from progressing, allowing people to live normal, healthy lives,”</strong> says Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of the NHS, about pembrolizumab.</p>

        <p>These results led the FDA to approve pembrolizumab as a treatment option for early-stage triple-negative breast cancer. Overall, the future holds promising prospects for this subtype as we anticipate the emergence of increasingly innovative immunotherapies.</p>

        <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
        <p>Drug resistance will undoubtedly continue to pose a formidable obstacle in the fight against breast cancer. However, with continued commitment to innovation, we can hope to one day overcome the challenge of drug resistance and provide more effective treatments for all breast cancer patients.</p>
